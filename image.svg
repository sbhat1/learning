  <title>Recursive SVG</title>
  <desc>An SVG with two recursive image reference to itself.
    One reference uses the file name as a relative URL,
    the other uses a target fragment only.
    When viewed in a processing mode that supports external file references,
    the embedded images should be rendered;
    however, the embedded image must be processed in secure mode,
    so the recursion only happens once.
    The appearance should be three nested red circles in a bulls-eye pattern;
    the innermost circle has solid fill because of target styles.
